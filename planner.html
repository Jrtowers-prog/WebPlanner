                        My name is Jamie and I am learning to build websites right now and thought, why not make a guide using what I've learned in order to help others.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        I am currently studying Computer Science and teaching myself to code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        That may sound like like a paradoxical statement, however I have learned that University is actually going to teach very little useful content.
                    </p>
                
                    <p>
                        Because of that I decided to start learning, and here I am making this site as I thought if I'm going to learn to make websites then a website about website making planning could be a good idea, or maybe not.

                <p>Think of Wireframing as a documented plan for the layout of a website, in the same way that a blueprint acts for a house.</p>
                
                <p>They are more useful than you might think, as having a pre-prepared layout allows you to pre-prepare as much as the code as possible, or atleast plan for it. This makes the development process itself much easier.</p>
                
                <p>Take the above with a pinch of salt as I didn't use a wireframe when designing this site, although if it looks bad, maybe this will act as a lesson!</p>

                    To get started you're going to need what you see above, HTML, CSS and Javascript, JS for short.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    HTML (or Hypertext Markup Language) is used to put together the building blocks of a website, titles, headers, paragraphs, footers etc.
                </p>
            
                <p>
                    CSS (or Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the website, adding colour, font, shape etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The final and probably most difficult language to learn is Javascript, this is not essential for making a basic website, I haven't used it for this. However for making a modern Web2/Web3 application Javascript is essential as it adds for complex functionality.
                </p>
